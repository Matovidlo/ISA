--------  ABOUT  -----------
Objective is monitoring computers, servers for accesibillity purposes.
Respond time is one of the key element of monitoring and in some cases is very important to have fast flow of information from our side to another.

-------- INSTALL -----------
Installation is easy, just compile source codes on linux with command:

make

Project was created to support older version of gcc4.8 and higher. Testovac is compiled with g++ since all header and source files are written in C++. Testing was performed with vagrant of centos and also on fedora 26 the project was developed.

-------- RUN PROGRAM -------
Program can be executed with simple command:

./testovac <node>

This result to an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST and ECHO_REPLY exchange from our node to <node>. It is very similar with tool 'ping'.

------- TOOL SUPPORT -------
